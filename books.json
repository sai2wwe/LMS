Wells\u2019s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine\u2019s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd There he discovers two bizarre races\u2014the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks\u2014who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells\u2019s expert storytelling and provocative insight, <b>The Time Machine</b> will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.<br /><br />",

        "description": "With H.G. Wells\u2019 other novels, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines \u2013 the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine \u2013 they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on. It is this which brings about a miraculous conclusion to this famous work of the imagination.",

In Anthem, Rand examines a frightening future in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. Equality 7-2521 lives in the dark ages of the future where all decisions are made by committee, all people live in collectives, and all traces of individualism have been wiped out. Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great \"we\" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--\"I.\"",
